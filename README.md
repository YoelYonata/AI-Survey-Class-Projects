# CMPT 310 - Artifical Intelligence Survey
This is a project that implements concepts from artificial intelligence class into a pacman game. There are four parts of the projects:
Searches, adversarial searches, reinforcement learning and tracking.

## Part 1 - Search
In this part of the project, we were tasked to implement three different searches: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and A* Search
